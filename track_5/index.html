      <p>We will never really know. Just like extra dimensions, it's something which we can not perceive. 

          Imagine living in a 2D world. You know only about forwards, backwards and sideways. Up and down is terms you can not understand, and someone can not explain it to you since they can not compare it to anything you know or that you can observe, since everything is in 2D. So if a 3D ball was to float above this 2D world, it would see the 2D word, but the 3D world would not see it, since they do not know about up and down. If this ball was to move downwards, through the 2D world, they would only see a small dot appear, which would then become wider and wider (since the ball becomes wider towards it's center), and then thinner and thinner again until it just disappears. They can only see on the X axis, and not the Y axis. 
          
          So will not be able to see a 4D object, since our minds can only understand 3 dimensional objects. So even if it is right in front of us, we might not even see it. But just like the 2D people might have seen a thin line appearing, which just disappears...we might catch glimpses of things appearing and then just disappearing which could point to another dimension existing with things in it. But other than suspecting it, we would not be able to go there, since our minds can not understand it, and we can not see it, even though it could be all around us at this very moment.
          
          The same goes for parallel universes. They could be all around us, but since we live in this one, we can not be aware of the other. 
          
          When talking about time travelling, then the need for parallel universes becomes more obvious, especially when thinking about the grandmother paradox, where you travel back in time to kill your grandmother. If you kill her, your mother did not get born, and thus, neither did you. If you did not get born, how could you have travelled back in time to kill her in the first place? Thus, if you then add in the possibility of parrallel universes, suddenly time travelling into the past could work, since you you could then time travel, but in essence when you do, you travel to another universe, in which you can kill your grandmother without causing any repercussions in the universe you came from. Thus, you only kill your grandmother in THAT universe, and not the one you came from.</p>
